## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- This is my first project using Flexbox and Responsive techniques. 
- This project helped me clear and built my basics for the same.
- And it also helped me learn some more CSS properties.


### Continued development

I will try to make some more projects for Flex Box and Responsive tricks to clear my concepts on better level. Further, I would like to learn CSS Grids and Bootstrap and make projects for the same.


### Useful resources

- [The Web Developer Bootcamp 2021](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) - I have been following this course for HTML and CSS
- [CSS Flexbox: A Complete Guide](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand FlexBox. 
- [A Complete Guide to CSS Media Queries](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-css-media-queries/) - This helped me in learning the basics of media queries. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
